You may not assign your rights under this Terms without <b>COEQUAL</b>'s prior written consent; <b>COEQUAL</b> may assign these Terms and transfer any of its rights or obligations at any time for any reason (including a transfer of any personal or other information you may have provided to us as part our transfer of assets associated with that information).</p>
